jappstart is a Java framework for Google App Engine built on Spring, Spring Security, and Sitemesh. The project aims to be the starting point for Google App Engine Java applications. It's not a framework in the traditional sense -- rather it is designed to provide a solid foundation for GAE/Java applications that can be easily extended by developers. Please see the [Getting Started Guide](http://code.google.com/p/jappstart/wiki/Tutorial).
